## Compressive Transformer in Pytorch (wip)

Pytorch implementation of <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SylKikSYDH">Compressive Transformers</a>, a variant of Transformer-XL with compressed memory for long-range language modelling. I will also combine this with an idea from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06764">another paper</a> that adds gating at the residual intersection. The memory and the gating may be synergistic, and lead to further improvements in both language modeling as well as reinforcement learning.
